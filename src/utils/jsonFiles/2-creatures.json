The beast continued to pursue the Jedi Knight, rending large holes in the hard-packed sand with its vicious stabs. It even shrugged off a pike attack, chomping through the offending polearm with bestial rage."

It has armor and limbs like a crustacean, but has the massive hinged jaws of other fishes. The opee is a silent hunter, typically lying in wait, clinging motionless to rocky crags. When it spots a tasty morsel, the creature captures its quarry with a long sticky tongue that drags struggling prey into a mouth filled with double rows of teeth."

With a small, plump body, two large eyes set far apart, horn rows on their back, and a prominent snout, puffer pigs are not physically impressive animals; in addition to their strange look, the creatures balloon to more than triple their size when frightened. Puffer pigs' real gift is their sense of smell, particularly for precious minerals. In the age of the Empire, when mining was restricted, this ability led to the trade of puffer pigs on the black market."
