Where the Empire opted for numbing routine, the First Order’s training simulations and live-fire drills encourage improvisation on the battlefield, making these stormtroopers more dangerous than their Imperial predecessors."

However, they are all trained in self-defense and remain vigilant against any threats to their sovereign. In fact, during times of turmoil, a handmaiden actually poses as the Queen.     The Naboo Royal Handmaidens have been selected for their various talents as well as for their resemblance to the Queen, which is useful if a decoy is required. After being invited to join the Queen's entourage, each handmaiden was trained in self defense and marksmanship. They often carry small, concealable blasters."

    "detail": "One of the wealthiest corporate organizations in the galaxy, the Trade Federation controlled most of the interstellar shipping passing through the Rim territories. The Trade Federation was headed by Viceroy Nute Gunray, and even had its own representative in the Republic Senate to lobby for even greater power. On the orders of Darth Sidious, the Trade Federation sent its battle droids to invade Naboo to create a government crisis. During the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation secretly signed on as a member of Count Dooku's Separatist organization, though representatives in the Senate tried to deny this."

    "detail": "Tusken Raiders, or Sand People as they are sometimes known, wear abundant clothing to protect themselves from Tatooine’s twin suns. The strong beings pursue a nomadic existence in some of Tatooine’s most desolate regions. They fear little, and make sudden raids on local settlers."

    "detail": "Survival in the unforgiving desert of Tatooine requires strict training and discipline for the youngest members of a Tusken tribe. Led by a chieftain, each member of the clan must learn to be useful. Tusken children begin mastery of the traditional gaffi stick at a young age. Some will become guards, watching over prisoners of the tribe and aided by attentive massiffs. Others will grow up to be skilled warriors, powerful in battle."

    "detail": "The junkboss Unkar Plutt enforces his control of Jakku’s salvage economy by paying dim-witted henchmen to watch for scavengers conducting unauthorized barter or otherwise challenging the Blobfish’s authority. Unkar’s thugs keep their faces hidden to conceal their identities, but Niima Outpost is a small place whose residents know the bullies by their voices, carriage and body language. The scavengers find the attempts at secrecy amusing -- unless they’re on the receiving end of one of Unkar’s punishments."

    "detail": "The Vanguard Axis is a fearsome droid cartel, in the business of smuggling and other underhanded dealings. Beyond selling off forged chain codes to those willing to pay for the fake identities to evade Imperial documentation, the heavily-armed droids are not above moving imprisoned living beings in their crate warehouse if they see a financial benefit to the scheme."

    "detail": "This band of space pirates haunts the shipping lanes of the lawless Outer Rim Territories, in search of cargos to steal and travelers to hold for ransom. They have prospered just enough to maintain a stronghold on a sulfurous world, where they keep stores of grog, food, and other comforts. During the ongoing Clone Wars, the pirates attempted to remain neutral lest they get too drawn into an unprofitable conflict."

The scrumrats are ruled by a small number of Grindalids, led by the White Worm matriarch, Lady Proxima."
