    "detail": "The Retail Caucus is one of the myriad corporate entities attracted into the command structure of the Separatist Alliance by Count Dooku's promises of unlimited pursuit of profits. Like its fellow corporations, the Retail Caucus brought with it its private droid army, adding its distinctive battle droids into the swelling ranks of the military commanded by General Grievous. Retail Caucus droids are towering brutes with barrel shaped bodies and spindly limbs. Each of its short arms terminate in a pair of laser cannons."

    "detail": "Like most battle droids employed by the Separatists, these assassin droids were manufactured by the Techno Union. They were employed in at least one known Separatist assassination plot. Their mission was to kill the Duchess Satine Kryze aboard her ship, the Coronet. Each Separatist Assassin Droid of this make boasted eight legs which they would use to lurk silently in for the kill. If they’re destroyed, they have smaller droids inside them that deploy to finish the job, making them especially lethal."

Like its more common cousin, the sniper droid rolls into position in a disc shape, and then unfurls when ready for combat. Unlike the droideka, the sniper droid has only one weapon -- a finely calibrated long-barrel blaster rifle. When in combat mode, the sniper droid's armored shell swings forward, becoming an armored shield with a embrasure from where the rifle barrel emerges."

    "detail": "The infantry used by the Trade Federation had several major shortcomings that were carefully revisited by the battle droids' designers. From that research came the super battle droid, a bulkier, stronger, and more advanced version of the standard mechanical soldier. The super battle droid requires no overriding command signal to operate, and thus has a limited degree of independence. They are fearless and tireless, and will run at full speed into combat, their cannons extended, firing until they have reduced their targets to smoldering ruins."

They earned their nickname, “tattletale droids” from their obnoxious demeanor in the pursuit of fulfilling their programming. They we’re manufactured by Serv-O-Droid, Inc. and were in use across the galaxy for years. During the Clone Wars, one was installed Rishi Station outpost and another was used by Gha Nachkt, a Trandoshan trader. Probably the most infamous and annoying TT-8L/Y7 in use was the one who kept out visitors out of Jabba’s Palace."

    "detail": "The effectiveness of droid starfighters has been debated in strategic circles for generations. While droid starfighters are capable of maneuvers that would crush even the sturdiest organic pilot, they lack the resourcefulness and cunning that living pilots bring into combat. To counter their shortcomings, vulture droids often attack en masse. Like the ground-based battle droid infantry, vulture droids were, for a time, controlled by a central command ship, but later generations were granted a limited degree of independence. When not in flight, the droid starfighter can transform into a walking mode allowing them to be used in surface patrols."
